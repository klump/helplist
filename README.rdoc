== README

This is a simple rails application which allows students to create help list entries.
These entries are then compiled into a list (which can be filtered by course code).

Admin functionality (reviewing closed item, starting and ending breaks) is available at /admin
The password for the admin area can be changed in the app/controllers/application_controller.rb file.

See the LICENSE file in the application root.
