== README

This is a simple rails application which allows students to create help list entries.
These entries are then compiled into a list (which can be filtered by course code).

There is even a rails task (rake entries:clear) which can be run via a cron job to clear all entries from the database.

== LICENSE

See the LICENSE file in the application root.
